This program, `mlfq.py`, allows you to see how the MLFQ scheduler presented in
this chapter behaves. See the README for details.

# Questions

1.  Run a few randomly-generated problems with just two jobs and two queues;
    compute the MLFQ execution trace for each. Make your life easier by
    limiting the length of each job and turning off I/Os.

2.  How would you run the scheduler to reproduce each of the examples in the
    chapter?

3.  How would you configure the scheduler parameters to behave just like a
    round-robin scheduler?

4.  Craft a workload with two jobs and scheduler parameters so that one job
    takes advantage of the older Rules 4a and 4b (turned on with the `-S` flag)
    to game the scheduler and obtain 99% of the CPU over a particular time
    interval.

5.  Given a system with a quantum length of 10 ms in its highest queue,
    how often would you have to boost jobs back to the highest priority level
    (with the `-B` flag) in order to guarantee that a single long-running
    (and potentially-starving) job gets at least 5% of the CPU?

6.  One question that arises in scheduling is which end of a queue to add a job
    that just finished I/O; the `-I` flag changes this behavior for this
    scheduling simulator. Play around with some workloads and see if you can see
    the effect of this flag.
